# ExplainableMusicSystem_VSTHost

This is a machine-learning system designed to generate and synthesise Midi notes based on an input Midi sequence. 

The latest build is available in the [Releases](https://github.com/SensiLab/ExplainableMusicSystem_VSTHost/releases) page.

It is a JUCE application so you need JUCE installed to build it.
